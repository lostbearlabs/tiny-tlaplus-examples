# Tiny TLA+ Example:  List Operations

This specification just demonstrates how to perform basic list operations on sequences.

In addition to using the operators `Append`, `Head`, `Tail`, and `\o` from the `Sequences` module, this example defines two versions of a `Reverse` operator, one in a declarative style and one in a functional style using a recursive operator definition.

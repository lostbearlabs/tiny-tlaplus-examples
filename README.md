# tiny-tlaplus-examples

## Description

This repo contains *very small* examples of TLA+ functionality or applications, intended to help you learn TLA+.

For more sophisticated examples, see:

* https://github.com/tlaplus/Examples
* https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/list-of-tla-examples/

## List of Examples

* **state-machine** :  TLA+ works by modeling systems via state machines.  If we model an actual state machine this way, how does the generated state graph compare to the machine we're modeling?
* **linear-search** : Example of using TLA+ to validate the correctness of a procedural algorithm.
* **secret-santa** : Example of using TLA+ to model a concurrent system.


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.  
* Please make sure examples are *very small*.
* Put each example in its own subfolder with a README.md file
* Name sub-folders and examples using the existing pattern of "spec-name" for the folder and "SpecName.tla" for the TLA+ file.
